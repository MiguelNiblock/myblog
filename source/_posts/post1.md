## Tools Research

- https://nosleepjavascript.com/gatsby-blog/ this is an article in a blog explaining how it was created with gatsby on github pages. It's quite complex though, and uses a bunch of unfamiliar things like yml, github actions. Not sure it's a good idea to follow such a specific guide, with little information on the why. It's more like a specific recipe.
- https://www.lambdatest.com/blog/best-javascript-framework-2020/ there's gatsby and next.
- https://blog.coursesity.com/popular-javascript-frameworks/ similar choices. But here there's electron. Interesting. Although meteor is supposedly also able to do multi platform.
- https://www.staticgen.com/ all static site gens. next and gatsby are here, as well as a new one: react-static. https://www.staticgen.com/react-static
  - https://medium.com/@tannerlinsley/%EF%B8%8F-introducing-react-static-a-progressive-static-site-framework-for-react-3470d2a51ebc article compares static-gen tools, and makes the point for react-static.

## Deployment

I've been seeing things about netlify in the sources above. It might be worth looking into. Apparently it connects with github, and it is a CDN for Jamstack sites. I don't know how CDN differs from something like heroku, or how Jamstack differs from MERN...

- https://areknawo.com/best-javascript-static-sites-generators-to-look-out-for-in-2020/ the basics of JAMstack. 
  - Next might be good. It's server side rendering, with react.
  - Simplest might be hexos, aimed at blog writers.

One consideration is cost. With a JAMstack site, there's no server, only hosting. So that's how it's possible to use github for it. Now i understand the first article on gatsby with github pages. One branch of the repo is for code and another is for content.

So I should look into deploying a static site on github with one of these frameworks. Perhaps react-static, or hexos, (or gatsby, lastly).

## Mobile App JS Frameworks

- https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/technology-and-apps/top-javascript-frameworks-for-mobile-app-development/ javascript frameworks for mobile app development. react native isn't even the #1... whatever,  its where the jobs are. others: meteor, xamarin, cordova, sencha... This stuff... is a hell of a specialized field, but it seems to be worth getting into it.
